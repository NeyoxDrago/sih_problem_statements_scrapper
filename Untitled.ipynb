For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient\\'s Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016). The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources. Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.). Abstract Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body\\'s response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/  Organization  GE Healthcare  Category  Software  Domain Bucket  Healthcare & Biomedical Devices  Youtube Link  Dataset Link  NA\",\"Description\":\"The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient\\'s Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016). The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources. Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.). Abstract Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body\\'s response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017).

Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.). Abstract Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body\\'s response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/  Organization  GE Healthcare  Category  Software  Domain Bucket  Healthcare & Biomedical Devices  Youtube Link  Dataset Link  NA\",\"Description\":\"The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient\\'s Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016). The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis.

The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature.

The smart phone-based Application captures the traffic flout and directly share it with traffic control team. App will have information about Traffic rules with best user interactive appearance. App will reduce Burden on traffic control team. PROBLEM STATEMENT: The traffic is huge problem in metro cities in India and to monitor it throughout a day it’s the difficult task. The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team. The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades).

The smart phone-based Application captures the traffic flout and directly share it with traffic control team. App will have information about Traffic rules with best user interactive appearance. App will reduce Burden on traffic control team. PROBLEM STATEMENT: The traffic is huge problem in metro cities in India and to monitor it throughout a day it’s the difficult task. The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team. The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules. OUTCOME EXPECTED: 1.

Ships use fuel, oils, sludge, sewage, water and other fluids, which are stored in tanks. When stored in tanks, these fluids tend to stick inside the tanks forming layers of semi-solid substance. Moreover, many impurities of these fluids settle down and stick to the surface of the tanks. It is therefore imperative that the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis on ships. Generally, tanks cleaning on the ship is done during dry dock and whenever the inspection of the tanks is due. Cleaning is done for inspection or if there is any work to be done inside the tanks such as cracks, leaks, etc. Tank cleaning inspection and repairs is a necessary procedure performed on board ships. This process, when carried out by humans, tends to be hazardous, sometimes leading to explosion and accidents. In spite of all the necessary safety precautions and enclosed space entry procedures, accidents still occur while inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks on board ships. (b)How it is being Overcome. The problem is, at present, being overcome by ventilating the tanks and use of personnel protective gears. However, the atmosphere in the tanks still remains unsatisfactory and continues to pose health hazards for human beings. The following procedure is followed before making an entry for tank cleaning: - •Fluid Contents of the tank should be removed as practicable as possible and stripped thoroughly before entering. •Ventilate the tank using thorough ventilation or forced ventilation method and make the tank suitable for man entry. •Before making a man entry, the atmosphere of the tank is tested for percentage of oxygen and availability of any toxic gases. This has to be done using remote access if possible, otherwise the person entering the tank for testing atmosphere must wear a breathing apparatus. •Various levels and compartments of tank is tested for the percentage of oxygen and availability of toxic gases. A multi gas analyser is used and a person who is trained and has the knowledge of using such equipment carries out the inspection. Once the tank is found safe for man entry, workers enter the tank and carry out cleaning, inspection, repairs etc. Working within these constrained spaces is hazardous, in spite of all the safety precautions. 4.Why it is Important to Solve. Effective solution of this problem is critical to avoid (a)time delays in inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks (b)accidents which still occur inside the tanks on board ships. (c)manpower cost. 5.Suggested Solutions. The problem can be resolved by developing a mechanism like a robotic arm with the following attachments: (a)Gas analyser for checking the percentage of oxygen and presence of toxic gases, (b)Camera for inspection of tank and examination of defect. (c)Cleaning Attachment (d)Repair attachments (e)Quality Inspection Equipment The robotic arm should be amenable for reliable operation on a ship and capable of entering the tanks and reaching all areas within.

Explain the general problem statement in simple terms. •Maximize the Turbine Power Generation •Un-availability of real time data from wind turbines •Delayed detection of mechanical and structural faults •Delayed order placements of spares/replacements •Reliance on manual inspection of every turbine The users of this system are two-fold: The distribution utility manager wants to monitor all the electrical wind turbine /transformers, so that he can maximize the turbine power generation. He wanted to track the real time health of all parts of turbine including generator, blades etc., live parameters monitored such as wind direction , temperature, current, voltage etc. on a geographical map, so that he can assign a repair crew member to resolve the issue on the open notification. The manager also wants to know the historical information to all the parameters being monitored to analyze the root cause of the failure and to predict the future outages. He also wants analytical dashboards which helps in the decision making process. However, the manager wants to make his decisions as per the smart data available i.e. live sensor data, historical sensor data, device metadata Technology that can address this issue partially. SAP Leonardo with S/4 Digital Core Since SAP Leonardo site on top of S/4 HANA, it easily integrates with S/4 Digital Core so that it will start reading Wind Turbine real time sensor data at one side and processing business transactions and applications at other. SAP Leonardo enables users to receive instant notifications of any failure events happening at Turbine Tower. When any issue rises such as oil leakage or break down, Leonardo will search for extra available spare part from S/4 Digital Core’s Warehouse Management Component. If a spare part exists in the S/4 warehouse, Leonardo will process a PTO (Pick Transfer Order) and assign a work order to nearest technician to a tower using his/her GPS coordinates. A technician will pick up the spare part from warehouse and fix the turbine issue. In case if Leonardo does not find spare part in S/4 Warehouse Component, it will automatically place a Purchase Order to a Vendor and maintain its record in a custom Z table. Once a factory user performs a GR (Goods Receive) for spare part through SAP t-code MIGO, Leonardo will check its existence in custom created Z table & if found, it will automatically create and assign a new work order to a technician. This integrated automation will drastically save time for troubleshooting & maximize the Turbine Power generation Desired Outcome: •Cost efficiency in maintaining and servicing wind turbines •Immediate order placement in case of inventory exhaustion. •To maintain the desired power output from wind farm to grid •Maximize the Turbine Power Generation •Real time insights of mechanical failures in wind turbines •Data Analysis of downtime and its causes •Pattern analysis thereby enabling better forecast  Organization  Cognizant Technology Solutions India Pvt.

If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration. Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts I.Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate ±5V output corresponding to ±5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone. II.An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.

Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation. Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizure A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost,portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn’t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures. The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body.The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring.

The ingredients of basti dravya are to be mixed in specific order to obtain the perfect mixture. Honey and rock salt were mixed together in the beginning followed by addition of Sesame oil. This mixture was then thoroughly mixed. The finely wet grinded paste of Herbal drugs was then mixed in it thoroughly. The decoction of\\xa0herbal drugs is then added to it and the mixture was subjected to thorough churning in a domestic mixer to produce a homogeneous mixture. The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion. Solution – If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speed There should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug.

The ingredients of basti dravya are to be mixed in specific order to obtain the perfect mixture. Honey and rock salt were mixed together in the beginning followed by addition of Sesame oil. This mixture was then thoroughly mixed. The finely wet grinded paste of Herbal drugs was then mixed in it thoroughly. The decoction of\\xa0herbal drugs is then added to it and the mixture was subjected to thorough churning in a domestic mixer to produce a homogeneous mixture. The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion. Solution – If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speed There should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug.
